# üçπ Happy Hour Discovery System

**GPT-5 Powered Multi-Source Verification with Voice Calls**

The most accurate happy hour information system ever built. We actually call restaurants to verify their happy hour details, then combine that with website scraping, Google data, and Yelp reviews using a mathematical consensus algorithm.

## üöÄ Why This is Revolutionary

1. **Voice Verification** - We make actual phone calls to restaurants (our competitors don't!)
2. **GPT-5 Exclusive** - Using GPT-5's reasoning capabilities for intelligent extraction
3. **Mathematical Consensus** - Weighted evidence scoring with confidence thresholds
4. **Multi-Source Truth** - Combines 4+ data sources for accuracy
5. **Cost Optimized** - Smart agent selection based on confidence levels
